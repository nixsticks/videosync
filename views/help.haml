      %span{:class=>"small left"} This makes you the controller of the room. That means you control when the video starts, stops, and pauses -- and you can seek to any position in the video you want.
      %span{:class=>"small left"} By sharing the link to your room, you can invite people to join you and watch the video in sync.
